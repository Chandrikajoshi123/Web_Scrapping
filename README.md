This project is a Pinterest-style image board built using Python and Streamlit. It mimics how APIs work, specifically for visual content fetching — using simulated data to demonstrate a real-world image scraping concept.

 ## What This Project Does
- Mimics an image search feature using simulated API logic
- Showcases an aesthetic, Pinterest-inspired UI layout
- Loads dynamic images using Unsplash URLs and local image assets
- Built to understand API integration through a fun, visual approach

## 📌 Why Simulated API?
 I originally planned to use the official Pinterest API but didn’t receive access in time. So, I created dummy data to mimic how an API-powered image board would function. It helped me learn the architecture, logic, and structure behind real API calls and how they power visual platforms.

⚠️ Note: This project originally intended to use the Pinterest API. Due to access restrictions, a simulated API-like structure was implemented to replicate similar functionality using static and placeholder data. This adaptation was necessary to continue learning and demonstrating core concepts effectively.
