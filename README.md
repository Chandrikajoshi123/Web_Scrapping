This project is a Pinterest Image Scraper that uses the official Pinterest API to fetch images based on user-defined search keywords. It’s built with Python and features a simple, user-friendly interface using Streamlit.

## Features

- Search for pins using any keyword (e.g. "aesthetic workspace", "vintage outfits")
- Fetch up to 100 images per term using official API pagination
- View pins in a Pinterest-like 5-column layout
- Download pin metadata (title, description, image URL) as CSV
- Secure access token management via Streamlit secrets

## 📌 Why Pinterest?

Pinterest is one of the most visually-rich platforms on the web. With categories ranging from fashion and home décor to food and travel, it’s a treasure trove of design, trends, and creative ideas.

Instead of scraping Pinterest’s HTML (which is against their terms), this project leverages their Developer API, ensuring ethical, stable, and future-proof access to pin data.

⚠️ Note: This project originally intended to use the Pinterest API. Due to access restrictions, a simulated API-like structure was implemented to replicate similar functionality using static and placeholder data. This adaptation was necessary to continue learning and demonstrating core concepts effectively.
