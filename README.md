This project is a Pinterest-style image board built using Python and Streamlit. It mimics how APIs work, specifically for visual content fetching — using simulated data to demonstrate a real-world image scraping concept.

 ## What This Project Does
- Mimics an image search feature using simulated API logic
- Showcases an aesthetic, Pinterest-inspired UI layout
- Loads dynamic images using Unsplash URLs and local image assets
- Built to understand API integration through a fun, visual approach

## 📌 Why Pinterest?

Pinterest is one of the most visually-rich platforms on the web. With categories ranging from fashion and home décor to food and travel, it’s a treasure trove of design, trends, and creative ideas.

Instead of scraping Pinterest’s HTML (which is against their terms), this project leverages their Developer API, ensuring ethical, stable, and future-proof access to pin data.

⚠️ Note: This project originally intended to use the Pinterest API. Due to access restrictions, a simulated API-like structure was implemented to replicate similar functionality using static and placeholder data. This adaptation was necessary to continue learning and demonstrating core concepts effectively.
